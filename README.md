# Introduction
For the final project, Iâ€™m exploring NBA basketball data collected from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), a comprehensive database that tracks detailed player and game statistics. Basetball Reference contains an enourmous amount of data so in order to make my analyis more manageable, I constructed a custom dataset specifically designed to support the goals of my investigation. To do this, I used BeatifulSoup to scrape player game log data for 139 NBA players across the 2022/2023, 2023/2024, 2024/2025 seasons as well as team roster data for the same seasons. Then I wrote custom functions to aggrgeate and modify the data in order to capture attributes relevant to my driving question. Speaking of which, the central question I'm exploring is:
**What is the relationship between the number of rebounds for a specific player in a given game and other statstics/player attributes?** While indeed the question is broad, it designed to help build upon the later prediction problem.
